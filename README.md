# Menu_Scraper
Version 1 of a web scraper I wrote to scrape menu information from the Allmenu.com website.

It is desighed to scrape any number of menus from a list of menus in the city of Atlanta. It scrapes the whole menu (names, prices, and descriptions) and stores the information into a CSV file. I hope that this information and the projects I can perform with it will one day be useful to me when I open my own restaurant.

I have a plethora of ideas for improvments and features for this project. I belive that a GUI to allow for the selection of a new city, and the selection of the number of menus to be scraped is the first place to start. At the moment, I am unsure if there are more effiecent ways to have the scraper scrape the menus, or store the data, but I am excited to streamline and improve this application, in hopes of gathering myself more data that deeply interest me for use in Data Engineering and Data Science projects.
